# Analysis-Of-Chondrocyte-Agarose-Construct-Parameters-To-Allow-Greater-Cell-Viability
The unique mechanical properties of the articular cartilage depend on the interactions between the chondrocytes and the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) that maintain the tissue. the main aim of this experiment is to determine the optimal in-vivo environment for chondrocytes to allow greater cell viability and gag concentration.
